## How it works

RISC-V instruction set architechture (ISA) is a highly customizble open standard platform. Its simplicity and modularity enables efficient design and optimization. This reduces development time and cost.

## How to test

RISC-V will be connected to a MATLAB via Serial UART (or VGA), where you will be able to create test its arithmetic performance.

## External hardware

PMOD VGA connection, Keyboard Connection, Mouse Connection
